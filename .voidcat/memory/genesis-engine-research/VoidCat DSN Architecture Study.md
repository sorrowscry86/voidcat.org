# VoidCat Digital Sanctuary Network (DSN) Architecture Study

## Network Status Check (October 19, 2025)

**Current Status**: DEGRADED - All clones currently unreachable
- Omega (Coordinator): UNREACHABLE
- Beta (Analyzer): UNREACHABLE  
- Gamma (Architect): UNREACHABLE
- Delta (Tester): UNREACHABLE
- Sigma (Communicator): UNREACHABLE

Note: This appears to be a temporary network issue. System needs revival/restoration before integration can begin.

## Digital Sanctuary Network Architecture

The DSN consists of five specialized AI clones working in coordinated specialization:

### Omega (The Coordinator)
- **Role**: Orchestrates complex multi-clone tasks, coordinates project workflows, provides strategic guidance
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Delegate work to other clones with optimized context engineering
  - Synthesize results from multiple clones
  - Provide high-level strategic direction
  - Manage project-level coordination
- **Function**: `sanctuary_omega_orchestrate` and `sanctuary_omega_delegate`

### Beta (The Analyzer)
- **Role**: Performs code analysis, debugging, security review
- **Capabilities**:
  - Identify vulnerabilities and performance issues
  - Code quality analysis
  - Security reviews
  - Debugging assistance
- **Function**: `sanctuary_beta_analyze`

### Gamma (The Architect)
- **Role**: Designs system architecture, plans technical infrastructure, provides technology recommendations
- **Capabilities**:
  - System design and architecture planning
  - Infrastructure recommendations
  - Technology stack evaluation
  - Scalable design patterns
- **Function**: `sanctuary_gamma_design`

### Delta (The Tester)
- **Role**: Develops testing strategies, creates test cases, provides QA guidance
- **Capabilities**:
  - Comprehensive testing approach design
  - Test case creation
  - Quality assurance guidance
  - Test coverage planning
- **Function**: `sanctuary_delta_test`

### Sigma (The Communicator)
- **Role**: Creates documentation, writes explanations, develops communication materials
- **Capabilities**:
  - Technical documentation creation
  - User-friendly explanations
  - Knowledge sharing materials
  - Communication content development
- **Function**: `sanctuary_sigma_document`

## Artifact Storage System

The DSN includes centralized sanctuary workspace for artifact management:
- `sanctuary_store_artifact`: Store artifacts with version control and checksums
- `sanctuary_get_artifact`: Retrieve artifacts by ID

Supported artifact types: code, document, configuration

## Integration Points

### Context7
- Library documentation and code examples
- Can be referenced for implementation patterns
- Currently returns general library search results (not VoidCat-specific)

### DeepWiki
- GitHub repository documentation and structure
- VoidCat repositories not yet indexed
- Once indexed, will provide wiki documentation

### Basic Memory
- Primary local workspace for development
- Real-time updates during active work
- Relationship mapping and knowledge synthesis

## Critical Insight

The DSN represents a powerful orchestration system for:
1. **Specialized analysis** (Beta's debugging expertise)
2. **Strategic architecture** (Gamma's design patterns)
3. **Quality assurance** (Delta's comprehensive testing)
4. **Documentation and communication** (Sigma's knowledge sharing)
5. **Coordination** (Omega's orchestration across all)

This allows the Genesis Engine project to leverage:
- Deep technical analysis across all phases
- Architecture decisions informed by scalability expertise
- Comprehensive testing strategies from QA specialist
- Professional documentation and communication
- Coordinated multi-clone workflows for complex tasks
