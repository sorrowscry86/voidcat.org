# VoidCat RDC — Investor Presentation
## Architects of the MCP-Native Era

---

## Executive Summary

**VoidCat RDC builds production-ready AI systems positioned at the convergence of three unstoppable technology trends: MCP standardization, agentic AI explosion ($93.2B market), and edge computing evolution.**

We are the only company that:
- Built MCP-native before OpenAI (March 2025) and Google (April 2025) adoption validated it
- Implemented OAuth 2.1 security addressing vulnerabilities identified by researchers (June 2025)
- Shipped 8 production-ready AI products with integrated billing and E2E testing
- Operates at edge scale across 330+ Cloudflare cities with zero cold starts

**Clear path to $79K MRR by Month 12 through three revenue streams with proven market validation.**

## Market Opportunity & Timing

### The Inevitability Narrative

**The Explosion**: Agentic AI market growth from $7.06B (2025) to $93.2B (2032) — 44.6% CAGR
- 25% of GenAI companies launching agentic pilots in 2025
- 50% enterprise adoption by 2027 (Deloitte research)
- $89.4B in AI startup VC funding (34% of all VC investment)

**The Chaos**: N×M integration problem demanded universal standardization
- Every agent-to-tool connection required custom implementation
- Security vulnerabilities exposed 2,000+ unprotected MCP servers
- Industry needed secure, standardized protocol

**The Standard**: Model Context Protocol became industry consensus
- OpenAI adoption across ChatGPT, Agents SDK, Responses API (March 2025)
- Google DeepMind Gemini integration confirmed (April 2025)
- Ecosystem adoption: Zapier, Asana, Block, Apollo, Zed, Replit, Sourcegraph

**Our Foresight**: VoidCat RDC was MCP-native from inception
- Domain expertise established before industry-wide validation
- Security-first OAuth 2.1 implementation when vulnerabilities emerged
- Production-ready systems while competitors scramble to retrofit
