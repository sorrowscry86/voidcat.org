**Target Domain:** voidcat.org

## ✅ Pre-Launch Verification Complete

All testing and quality assurance complete. Critical issues resolved. Website ready for production deployment.

## Next Steps for Launch

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages (5 minutes)
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from branch → `main`
3. Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Click "Save"
5. Wait for initial deployment (~2 minutes)

### 2. Configure Custom Domain (5 minutes)
1. In GitHub Pages settings, add custom domain: `voidcat.org`
2. Check "Enforce HTTPS" (after DNS propagates)
3. GitHub will automatically provision SSL certificate

### 3. Configure DNS at Domain Registrar (10 minutes)
Add these DNS records at your domain registrar:

**A Records (for apex domain):**
```
@    A    185.199.108.153
@    A    185.199.109.153
@    A    185.199.110.153
@    A    185.199.111.153
```

**CNAME Record (for www subdomain - optional):**
```
www  CNAME  sorrowscry86.github.io.
```

### 4. Wait for DNS Propagation (24-48 hours)
- Check propagation: https://dnschecker.org
- Test site at: https://sorrowscry86.github.io/voidcat.org (immediate)
- Custom domain: https://voidcat.org (after DNS propagation)
