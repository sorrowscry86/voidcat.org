# GitHub Pages Launch Readiness Checklist

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Repository:** https://github.com/sorrowscry86/voidcat.org  
**Target Domain:** voidcat.org  
**Status:** ✅ DNS VERIFIED - GITHUB PAGES PENDING

---

## ✅ Pre-Launch Verification Complete

All testing and quality assurance complete. Critical issues resolved. DNS fully configured. Website ready for production deployment on GitHub Pages.

---

## Next Steps for Launch

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages (5 minutes)
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from branch → `main`
3. Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Click "Save"
5. Wait for initial deployment (~2 minutes)

### 2. Configure Custom Domain (5 minutes)
1. In GitHub Pages settings, add custom domain: `voidcat.org`
2. Check "Enforce HTTPS" (after DNS propagates)
3. GitHub will automatically provision SSL certificate

### 3. DNS Already Configured ✅ (SKIP - Already Done)

**Verification Complete at Squarespace:**

**A Records (for apex domain) - ✅ VERIFIED:**
```
@    A    185.199.108.153  ✅
@    A    185.199.109.153  ✅
@    A    185.199.110.153  ✅
@    A    185.199.111.153  ✅
```

**CNAME Record (for www subdomain) - ✅ VERIFIED:**
```
www  CNAME  sorrowscry86.github.io.  ✅
```

**Email Records Preserved:**
```
@    MX    smtp.google.com  ✅
@    TXT   SPF record (Google)  ✅
google._domainkey  TXT   DKIM  ✅
```

### 4. Wait for DNS Propagation (5 minutes - 24 hours)
DNS is already configured. Timing depends on GitHub Pages enablement:
- **Immediate (after Pages enabled):** https://sorrowscry86.github.io/voidcat.org
- **Custom domain (5 min - 24 hrs):** https://voidcat.org
- Check propagation: https://dnschecker.org
- Monitor with: `dig voidcat.org` or `nslookup voidcat.org`
