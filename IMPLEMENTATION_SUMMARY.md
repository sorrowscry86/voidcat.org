### 2. Automated Publishing Pipeline

**How It Works:**

```
Write Markdown → Git Push → Auto-Generate HTML → Live on Site
         ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
  blog/posts/    GitHub Actions   blog/index.html  voidcat.org/blog/
   article.md      workflow         + post pages     (2-3 min)
```

**Components Built:**

#### A. Blog Post Template (`blog/posts/_template.md`)
- Pre-structured markdown file
- YAML frontmatter with all required fields
- Section scaffolding for consistent articles

#### B. Publishing Directory (`blog/posts/`)
- Central location for all blog content
- One markdown file = one published article
- Drafts supported (`status: "draft"`)

#### C. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/publish-blog.yml`)
- **Triggers:** Automatically on push to `blog/posts/**/*.md`
- **Actions:**
  1. Parses markdown files with YAML frontmatter
  2. Generates `blog/index.html` (sorted, categorized listing)
  3. Generates individual post pages (`blog/posts/{slug}.html`)
  4. Commits updated HTML automatically
  5. Deploys to GitHub Pages (live in 2-3 minutes)

#### D. Blog Generator Script (`.github/scripts/generate-blog-index.js`)
- Node.js script using `gray-matter` + `marked`
- Parses YAML frontmatter from markdown
- Converts markdown to HTML with syntax highlighting
- Sorts posts by date (newest first)
- Categorizes by topic (Architecture, Security, Performance, Engineering, Research)
- Filters published vs. draft
- Highlights featured articles for homepage

#### E. Publishing Documentation (`PUBLISHING_GUIDE.md`)
- **Quick start** — Publish your first article in 5 steps
- **YAML reference** — All frontmatter fields explained
- **Markdown guide** — Formatting, code blocks, tables, images
- **Workflow** — Daily, bulk, and editing workflows
- **Troubleshooting** — Common issues and solutions
- **Best practices** — Writing, SEO, code examples

#### F. CSS Enhancements (`styles.css`)
- `.prose` class for article content styling
- Headers, paragraphs, lists, blockquotes
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables, images, horizontal rules
- Tag badges for topics
- Fully responsive mobile design

## Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

This installs:
- `gray-matter` (YAML frontmatter parsing)
- `marked` (Markdown to HTML conversion)

### 2. Test Locally (Optional)

```powershell
npm run generate
```

This runs the blog generator script locally to verify it works.

### 3. Commit Everything

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add publishing pipeline and living status document"
git push origin main
```

This pushes all new files to GitHub.

### 4. Verify GitHub Actions

1. Visit: https://github.com/sorrowscry86/voidcat.org/actions
2. Wait for "Publish Blog Updates" workflow to complete
3. Check for green checkmark (success)

### 5. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md

Replace template content with actual current information:
- Real MRR numbers (or $0 if pre-launch)
- Actual product status
- Current roadmap progress
- Real metrics (not placeholder values)

### 6. Publish Your First Article

Use the template to create your first blog post — perhaps announcing the new publishing system or sharing a technical insight.
