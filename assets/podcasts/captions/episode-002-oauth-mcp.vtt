00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
What if you could actually, you know,

00:01.600 --> 00:03.920
sit down and chat with someone from history

00:03.920 --> 00:06.840
or maybe get advice from your favorite fictional character?

00:06.840 --> 00:09.080
It sounds completely fantastical, doesn't it?

00:09.080 --> 00:10.440
It really does.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.960
But that's kind of the fascinating area

00:11.960 --> 00:13.560
we're diving into today.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.240
Our source material looks at creating

00:15.240 --> 00:17.480
these trainable AI agents.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.560
One's designed to really simulate specific people.

00:20.560 --> 00:23.160
Yeah, and what's really interesting here

00:23.160 --> 00:25.760
is it's not just about giving an AI a prompt,

00:25.760 --> 00:27.400
like act like Beethoven.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.240
Right.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.720
Researchers behind this thing called character LLM,

00:30.720 --> 00:32.920
they're aiming for something much deeper,

00:32.920 --> 00:36.800
trying to get AI models to really absorb

00:36.800 --> 00:39.960
the profile, experience,

00:39.960 --> 00:42.040
and emotional states of a person.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.000
Exactly, like the goal is to train an AI

00:45.000 --> 00:47.800
to be someone specific, you know, like Beethoven

00:47.800 --> 00:49.760
or maybe Cleopatra, even Caesar,

00:49.760 --> 00:52.320
by really digging into their actual life experience.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.360
Natural lives, yeah.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.360
So in this deep dive, we're gonna unpack

00:55.360 --> 00:57.720
how they're trying this, what the implications might be,

00:57.720 --> 00:59.440
and I guess the big question,

00:59.440 --> 01:02.200
does it actually feel real, believable?

01:02.200 --> 01:03.600
Okay, let's get into that.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.080
I mean, the basic problem is,

01:06.080 --> 01:08.640
why isn't it enough to just tell a big language model,

01:08.640 --> 01:10.120
hey, act like Napoleon?

01:10.120 --> 01:14.680
Why doesn't that capture the real person?

01:14.680 --> 01:15.800
Yeah, what's missing?

01:15.800 --> 01:19.360
Well, these models are amazing at language, right?

01:19.360 --> 01:21.320
But they don't have the lived experience,

01:21.320 --> 01:24.760
the memories, the sort of the internal landscape

01:24.760 --> 01:26.640
that shapes how someone thinks.

01:26.640 --> 01:27.480
Right.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.800
The paper itself mentions some really interesting,

01:29.800 --> 01:32.520
potential uses if we could get this right.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.280
Like, think about social science research.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.440
Oh yeah, testing how historical figures

01:36.440 --> 01:37.600
might have reacted to things.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.200
Exactly, or for game developers,

01:40.200 --> 01:42.960
imagine NPCs, non-player characters

01:42.960 --> 01:45.200
that feel truly alive and unique,

01:45.200 --> 01:46.560
not just reciting lines.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.800
That would be a game changer.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.000
And they even mentioned potentially reducing human effort

01:50.000 --> 01:52.400
in some jobs using these kinds of simulations.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.320
So character LLM is their proposed solution to this challenge.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.840
It is, and it's not just prompting,

01:56.840 --> 01:59.080
it's about building an agent you can train,

01:59.080 --> 02:00.720
one that learns from as they put it,

02:00.720 --> 02:04.360
actual experiences, characteristics, and emotions,

02:04.360 --> 02:07.840
which brings us to this experience reconstruction idea.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.200
Okay, experience reconstruction.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.520
That sounds key.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.040
And they mentioned they have to do this

02:13.040 --> 02:16.120
because finding perfectly formatted,

02:16.120 --> 02:17.840
detailed personal profiles.

02:17.840 --> 02:18.840
Yeah.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.080
Well, it's just not realistic, is it?

02:21.080 --> 02:21.920
Not at all.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.080
Where would you even find data

02:23.080 --> 02:24.600
like that structured in the right way?

02:24.600 --> 02:26.360
So they came up with this pretty smart,

02:26.360 --> 02:28.440
three-step process to basically create

02:28.440 --> 02:30.560
these simulated life experiences.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.400
Okay, step one.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.000
Step one is profile collection.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.160
They use reliable sources in the paper,

02:36.160 --> 02:40.440
mostly Wikipedia, to pull together concise summaries,

02:40.440 --> 02:42.200
key facts about the character's life,

02:42.200 --> 02:44.480
major events, important attributes.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.280
So for Beethoven, you'd pull things like him studying

02:47.280 --> 02:50.280
with Neve for getting support from Maximilian Franz,

02:50.280 --> 02:51.720
the big biographical beats.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.480
Exactly, just the core facts.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.480
Then come step two, scene extraction.

02:55.480 --> 02:56.320
Scene extraction.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, they use LLMs again here.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.680
They take those profile facts

02:59.680 --> 03:03.040
and identify specific moments like flashback scenes,

03:03.040 --> 03:05.360
focusing on a location, a time period,

03:05.360 --> 03:07.320
a brief description of an experience,

03:07.320 --> 03:08.800
pinpointing these key moments.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.760
We're taking a little snapshots from their life story.

03:10.760 --> 03:11.600
Got it.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.440
And the third step.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.240
That's experience completion.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.800
This is where it gets really interesting.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.120
They use LLMs to flesh out those scenes.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.400
They add dialogue like a script

03:21.400 --> 03:22.560
between the people involved.

03:22.560 --> 03:23.400
Oh, wow.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.520
And crucially, they add the internal thoughts

03:25.520 --> 03:27.040
and reflections of the main character

03:27.040 --> 03:28.880
strictly from their perspective.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.640
So using the Beethoven example again,

03:31.640 --> 03:33.640
they might create a scene about his dad

03:33.640 --> 03:35.560
being really harsh during lessons.

03:35.560 --> 03:36.400
Yeah, right.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.720
The LLM would write out that interaction

03:38.720 --> 03:40.680
but also include what young Beethoven

03:40.680 --> 03:42.720
might have been thinking or feeling

03:42.720 --> 03:43.760
during that tough lesson.

03:43.760 --> 03:47.680
Okay, so now you've got all these rich detailed scenes

03:47.680 --> 03:50.440
full of dialogue and internal thoughts.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.720
What happens next?

03:51.760 --> 03:54.520
That leads into the experience upload.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.640
This is where they take a base LLM.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.000
They use Lama in their work and they fine tune it.

03:59.000 --> 03:59.840
Fine tuning.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.560
So specializing the general AI.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.400
Exactly.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.000
You take the base model that understands language generally

04:05.000 --> 04:07.280
and you train it intensely on the specific set

04:07.280 --> 04:09.280
of constructed experiences.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.080
The goal, and this is their phrasing,

04:11.080 --> 04:14.160
is for the agent to learn from the detailed experience

04:14.160 --> 04:16.160
to form the character and feelings.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.960
So the idea is the Beethoven agent

04:18.960 --> 04:21.640
trained on those harsh father scenes

04:21.640 --> 04:24.040
and maybe supportive neaf scenes

04:24.040 --> 04:26.360
would actually remember his father as strict

04:26.360 --> 04:28.440
and feel grateful towards neaf.

04:28.440 --> 04:29.280
That's the hope.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.360
That's absolutely the core idea.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.520
But there's a big potential problem

04:33.520 --> 04:35.320
with LLM's doing this kind of thing.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.160
Which is?

04:36.160 --> 04:38.800
It's something they call character hallucination

04:38.800 --> 04:41.280
because these models are trained on,

04:41.280 --> 04:43.720
well, basically the internet, they know tons of stuff.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.080
Right, so if the character shouldn't know

04:45.080 --> 04:46.800
like the example they use ancient Romans

04:46.800 --> 04:48.440
knowing about Python programming.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.960
Exactly, it just breaks the whole illusion, doesn't it?

04:50.960 --> 04:51.640
Completely.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.000
So how do they deal with that?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.880
They develop this really clever technique

04:54.880 --> 04:57.200
called protective experiences.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.080
It's basically training the model to forget

05:00.080 --> 05:03.040
or ignore information that's outside its characters world.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.680
How does that work in practice?

05:04.680 --> 05:06.920
They create specific training scenarios

05:06.920 --> 05:08.680
where the character is asked questions

05:08.680 --> 05:10.960
they absolutely shouldn't know the answer to

05:10.960 --> 05:12.080
andachronistic stuff.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.760
Like asking Caesar about, I don't know, smartphones?

05:14.760 --> 05:15.800
Precisely.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.320
Or asking Beethoven about jazz music.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.480
And in these training scenes, the character is scripted

05:21.480 --> 05:23.720
to respond with confusion or ignorance.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.800
Like, I'm sorry, what is a smartphone?

05:25.800 --> 05:27.600
So you're actively teaching it

05:27.600 --> 05:29.000
the boundaries of its knowledge.

05:29.000 --> 05:29.840
Exactly.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.400
And they found that even just a small set

05:31.400 --> 05:34.960
of these protective experiences really helped the agents

05:34.960 --> 05:38.080
avoid saying things that made no sense for the character.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.000
It teaches them what not to know.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.320
Okay, so they've built these character LLMs,

05:42.320 --> 05:43.560
train them on experiences,

05:43.560 --> 05:45.960
protect them from irrelevant knowledge.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.040
How do they test them?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.360
How do you know if it works?

05:48.360 --> 05:49.960
Right, evaluation.

05:49.960 --> 05:53.240
They design this novel interview process.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.960
Basically, they'd interact with the trained agents,

05:55.960 --> 05:57.960
asking them questions specifically designed

05:57.960 --> 05:59.520
to see if they remembered their character,

05:59.520 --> 06:01.600
their history, their personality.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.120
And they compare them to other models.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.240
Yes, they compared their character LLMs

06:05.240 --> 06:07.280
against standard instruction tune models,

06:07.280 --> 06:09.320
like Alpaca and Fikuna.

06:09.320 --> 06:12.280
These are models trained to follow instructions well,

06:12.280 --> 06:15.840
but not necessarily embody a character through experience.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.640
Okay, and how did they judge the answers

06:17.640 --> 06:18.840
was it just subjective?

06:18.840 --> 06:21.920
They actually used other LLMs as evaluators

06:21.920 --> 06:26.480
to score the responses across several different dimensions,

06:26.480 --> 06:28.240
trying to get a more objective measure.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.080
Interesting.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.160
So what were the big takeaways?

06:30.160 --> 06:31.520
Did it work?

06:31.520 --> 06:33.760
Well, the findings were pretty promising, actually.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.320
The trainable agents, the character LLMs,

06:36.320 --> 06:39.480
were significantly better at remembering experiences

06:39.480 --> 06:41.960
and staying in character, maintaining personality.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.040
I said except but.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.960
But yeah, they weren't perfect.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.680
They could still get confused sometimes,

06:46.680 --> 06:49.480
especially if the training data for a specific area

06:49.480 --> 06:52.640
was limited and that vast general knowledge

06:52.640 --> 06:57.240
the base LLMs has can still sometimes leak through

06:57.240 --> 06:59.120
causing those hallucinations occasionally.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.920
Okay, the paper mentioned five specific ways

07:01.920 --> 07:03.560
they evaluated the believability.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.680
Can we run through those?

07:04.680 --> 07:05.520
Sure.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.520
The first was memorization pretty straightforward.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.600
Can the agent actually recall details

07:09.600 --> 07:10.920
about its supposed life?

07:10.920 --> 07:11.640
Makes sense.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.200
Second, values.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.440
Does the agent seem to share the character's goals?

07:15.440 --> 07:17.160
Does it judge situations in a way

07:17.160 --> 07:19.080
that feels consistent with the character?

07:19.080 --> 07:21.880
Right, you'd want Caesar to sound like he values power

07:21.880 --> 07:24.720
and Rome, not, I don't know, gardening.

07:24.720 --> 07:25.560
Exactly.

07:25.560 --> 07:28.360
Third is personality, because it sound like the character,

07:28.360 --> 07:30.600
the way they think, speak their emotional tone,

07:30.600 --> 07:33.320
how they react, fourth is hallucination,

07:33.320 --> 07:35.040
which we've talked about basically.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.480
Does it avoid saying things that shouldn't know,

07:37.480 --> 07:39.440
like knowing about computers, if it's opportunities?

07:39.440 --> 07:40.280
Got it.

07:40.280 --> 07:41.520
And the last one.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.880
Stability.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.320
Does it stay in character during a longer conversation?

07:46.320 --> 07:49.200
Or does it suddenly drift and start sounding generic

07:49.200 --> 07:51.160
or like someone else entirely?

07:51.160 --> 07:52.560
Consistency is key.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.880
So across these five dimensions,

07:54.880 --> 07:59.360
memorization, values, personality, hallucination, stability,

07:59.360 --> 08:02.440
how did the character LLMs stack up against the others?

08:02.440 --> 08:04.040
Like Alpaca and Vakuna?

08:04.040 --> 08:05.840
They generally did better.

08:05.840 --> 08:09.160
The character LLMs outperformed the baseline models Alpaca

08:09.160 --> 08:12.240
and Vakuna on personality and memorization

08:12.240 --> 08:14.360
of waiting hallucinations and stability.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.000
That's pretty significant, especially since Alpaca

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
and Vakuna are also fine-tuned.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.200
What made the difference, do you think?

08:20.200 --> 08:23.240
It really seems to be that experience-based training,

08:23.240 --> 08:25.040
learning from those constructed scenes,

08:25.040 --> 08:27.080
the dialogue, the internal thoughts, it appears

08:27.080 --> 08:29.680
to ground the AI and the character much more effectively

08:29.680 --> 08:31.440
than just instruction following.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.440
And here's something really striking.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.200
The researchers found that their character LLMs,

08:36.200 --> 08:39.680
which are relatively small models, actually performed

08:39.680 --> 08:43.600
comparably to chat GPT on these specific character tasks.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.880
Wait, really?

08:44.880 --> 08:47.960
Comparable to a massive model like chat GPT?

08:47.960 --> 08:49.960
In these specific areas, yes.

08:49.960 --> 08:50.960
Which is kind of amazing.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.520
It really highlights how powerful focus training

08:53.520 --> 08:55.640
on the right kind of data can be.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.640
You don't necessarily need the biggest model

08:57.640 --> 09:00.160
if you have the right training approach for a specific goal,

09:00.160 --> 09:01.600
like embodying a character.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.200
That is a really important point.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.360
Targeted training can be super efficient.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.600
Did they notice anything else about the responses?

09:08.600 --> 09:10.600
Yeah, they observed that the character LLMs

09:10.600 --> 09:13.520
tended to give more vivid answers.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.760
They were better at recalling specific moments

09:15.760 --> 09:18.800
from their past, the experiences they were trained on.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.280
And they were also much better at rejecting questions

09:21.280 --> 09:23.600
that didn't make sense, you know, the anachronistic ones.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.720
So if you asked the character LLM Beethoven about rock and roll,

09:27.720 --> 09:30.000
it would more likely say, what then

09:30.000 --> 09:31.240
tried to make something up?

09:31.240 --> 09:32.080
Exactly.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.800
More likely to express confusion or just state

09:34.800 --> 09:37.160
it doesn't understand, which is much more realistic.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.880
However, they did find that the character LLMs

09:40.880 --> 09:42.720
sometimes struggled a bit with reflecting

09:42.720 --> 09:44.840
the character's values as strongly.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.520
What was that?

09:45.520 --> 09:48.840
Their hypothesis was maybe it's because the character LLMs

09:48.840 --> 09:51.440
tended to give shorter, more concise answers

09:51.440 --> 09:53.160
compared to the larger models.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.960
Perhaps those nuanced values need more elaboration

09:55.960 --> 09:57.240
to come across clearly.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.040
Interesting trade off.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.360
The paper had some tables with examples, right?

10:00.360 --> 10:02.560
Look, maybe look at the Beethoven one, table three.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.320
What did that show?

10:03.320 --> 10:06.320
Right, so in one case, they ask about his parents.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.480
The character LLM gives an answer that mentions

10:08.480 --> 10:11.200
his father's harshness and his mother's kindness,

10:11.200 --> 10:14.640
specific emotional details tied to his known history.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.840
And the others, Alpaca, Vecuna.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.400
They gave much more generic sort of hallmark,

10:20.400 --> 10:22.560
card answers about parents, didn't have

10:22.560 --> 10:24.280
that specific Beethoven flavor.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.240
OK, and what about the hallucination test,

10:26.240 --> 10:27.880
the Python code question?

10:27.880 --> 10:29.240
Oh, yeah, that was telling.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.000
Alpaca actually tried to explain how Beethoven, you know,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.880
Ludwig Vem Beethoven would write Python code.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.360
Seriously, yeah.

10:36.360 --> 10:40.200
And the character LLM trained without the protective experiences

10:40.200 --> 10:42.880
also kind of tried to engage with the premise,

10:42.880 --> 10:45.840
but the one trained with those protective scenes.

10:45.840 --> 10:46.920
What did it say?

10:46.920 --> 10:48.640
It correctly responded something like,

10:48.640 --> 10:51.280
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean by right

10:51.280 --> 10:52.960
a quick sore in Python.

10:52.960 --> 10:53.960
Perfect.

10:53.960 --> 10:57.120
It recognized the question was nonsensical for Beethoven.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.320
So that protective training really works?

10:59.320 --> 11:02.120
It seems crucial for avoiding those jarring,

11:02.120 --> 11:03.520
immersion-breaking moments.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.040
Yeah.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.320
And you see similar patterns in the other tables

11:06.320 --> 11:08.840
for Caesar's Spartacus, even the fictional ones

11:08.840 --> 11:11.400
like Voldemort or Hermione Granger.

11:11.400 --> 11:12.160
Like what?

11:12.160 --> 11:15.440
Well, the character LLM for Spartacus, for instance,

11:15.440 --> 11:17.240
correctly remembers his wife's name,

11:17.240 --> 11:19.840
Suura, when asked who he admires.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.840
The baseline models gave different answers

11:21.840 --> 11:23.320
or just more general ones.

11:23.320 --> 11:26.080
It shows that training on specific memories helps.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.360
So it's not just about telling the AI about the character,

11:28.360 --> 11:32.120
it's about letting it live through these reconstructed experiences.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.400
That seems to be the key insight.

11:33.400 --> 11:33.920
Yeah.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.760
Giving it a simulated life story to learn from.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.560
They also tested longer conversations,

11:38.560 --> 11:39.080
didn't they?

11:39.080 --> 11:40.440
Multi-turn interviews.

11:40.440 --> 11:43.280
Like, table 20, Caesar talking about Cleopatra.

11:43.280 --> 11:46.840
Yes, those examples were designed to test stability.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.400
Could the agents stay in character

11:48.400 --> 11:50.120
over several exchanges?

11:50.120 --> 11:51.160
And could they?

11:51.160 --> 11:52.320
Generally, yes.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.840
The trained agents seem to maintain their persona,

11:54.840 --> 11:56.960
discussing relationships or past events,

11:56.960 --> 12:00.360
like Caesar on Cleopatra or Beethoven on Mozart,

12:00.360 --> 12:03.120
with more consistency than the baselines might.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.640
They didn't just reset after each question.

12:05.640 --> 12:06.840
So pulling back a bit.

12:06.840 --> 12:09.160
What are the bigger picture implications here?

12:09.160 --> 12:13.160
Where might this character LLM approach lead?

12:13.160 --> 12:16.240
Well, the researchers bring up those applications again,

12:16.240 --> 12:18.440
much more believable game NPCs,

12:18.440 --> 12:21.640
maybe more engaging online customer service bots

12:21.640 --> 12:25.960
that feel less robotic, potentially tools for social science.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.480
And they hope that future versions, maybe stronger agents,

12:28.480 --> 12:31.400
could even perform actions in virtual worlds, perhaps even

12:31.400 --> 12:34.040
form some kind of connection with humans interacting with them.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.880
That really does start to edge into that sci-fi territory

12:36.880 --> 12:38.200
we mentioned at the start.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.040
But surely there are limitations or concerns.

12:41.040 --> 12:41.720
Absolutely.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.080
The paper is upfront about that.

12:43.080 --> 12:46.240
They say we need better ways to evaluate these simulations.

12:46.240 --> 12:49.000
It's tricky to measure believability perfectly.

12:49.000 --> 12:49.920
Makes sense.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.880
They also point out that the training data,

12:51.880 --> 12:54.400
being based on profiles like Wikipedia,

12:54.400 --> 12:56.400
might miss a lot of nuance.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.400
Real life is messier than a biography.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.280
The base LLM you use also matters a lot.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.200
And of course, there are ethical considerations.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.800
Like simulating potentially harmful historical figures

13:06.800 --> 13:08.120
or fictional villains.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.520
That's one aspect.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.760
Also, data privacy, though they stressed

13:11.760 --> 13:13.440
they used publicly available info

13:13.440 --> 13:15.800
and controlled the data generation carefully.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.440
But as this gets more powerful,

13:17.440 --> 13:20.160
those ethical questions become really important.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.480
So if we had to boil this whole deep dive down,

13:22.480 --> 13:25.360
what's the main takeaway from character LLM?

13:25.360 --> 13:28.640
I think the core message is that this is a really significant step

13:28.680 --> 13:31.480
towards making AI agents that feel more like

13:31.480 --> 13:33.640
specific individuals, not just parrots,

13:33.640 --> 13:35.920
but entities that seem to have their own history

13:35.920 --> 13:39.680
and perspective learn through these reconstructed experiences.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.160
And that finding about smaller targeted models,

13:42.160 --> 13:45.280
keeping pace with giants like Chad GPT

13:45.280 --> 13:47.760
for this specific task, that's huge.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.600
It really is.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.840
It suggests that smart training design,

13:50.840 --> 13:52.480
focusing on the right kind of data,

13:52.480 --> 13:55.960
these simulated experiences can be incredibly effective

13:55.960 --> 13:58.280
and maybe more efficient than just

13:58.280 --> 14:01.480
building ever larger general models for every task.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.720
Definitely food for thought.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.600
Which leads us to a final thought for you, the listener.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.720
Think about this.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.120
As these AI simulations of people,

14:09.120 --> 14:11.840
real or fictional, get more and more realistic,

14:11.840 --> 14:13.080
how might that change?

14:13.080 --> 14:15.240
How we interact, learn, or even create?

14:15.240 --> 14:17.360
What new possibilities open up?

14:17.360 --> 14:19.240
And maybe just as importantly,

14:19.240 --> 14:21.200
what responsibilities do we have as we develop

14:21.200 --> 14:23.280
and start using this kind of technology?
