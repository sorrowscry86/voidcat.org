## Critical Issues Found and Resolved

### Issue #1: Domain Mismatch (RESOLVED ✅)
**Problem:** CNAME file said `voidcat.org` but `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` referenced `voidcatrdc.com`

**Impact:** SEO confusion, broken sitemap reference

**Resolution:**
- Updated all 18 URLs in sitemap.xml from voidcatrdc.com → voidcat.org
- Updated robots.txt Sitemap directive to https://voidcat.org/sitemap.xml
- Verified zero instances of old domain remain

### Issue #2: 404 Page Branding (RESOLVED ✅)
**Problem:** 404 error page had placeholder "Your Company" branding

**Impact:** Unprofessional appearance if users hit 404 page

**Resolution:**
- Updated page title to "Page Not Found — VoidCat RDC"
- Changed logo reference from logo.svg to logo.png (matches other pages)
- Updated alt text to "VoidCat RDC logo"
- Updated brand text to "VoidCat RDC"

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Pre-Launch Actions (Required)
- ✅ All critical fixes applied and committed
- ⏳ Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
- ⏳ Configure custom domain (voidcat.org) in GitHub Pages settings
- ⏳ Add DNS records at domain registrar (see UPLOAD_GUIDE.md)
- ⏳ Wait for DNS propagation (typically 24-48 hours)

### 2. Post-Launch Monitoring (Recommended)
- Monitor Google Search Console for crawl errors
- Verify sitemap.xml is discovered by search engines
- Check robots.txt is accessible at https://voidcat.org/robots.txt
- Test all pages from live URL to ensure proper serving
- Monitor analytics for 404 errors (if analytics added later)

### 3. Optional Enhancements (Non-Critical)
- Consider adding Open Graph meta tags for social media sharing
- Consider adding JSON-LD structured data for enhanced SEO
- Could add Google Analytics or privacy-friendly alternative
- Could add cookie consent banner if cookies are added later
- Logo PNG could be optimized from 456KB → ~200KB (minor improvement)

### 4. Maintenance Schedule (Suggested)
- Review and update roadmap page quarterly (Q1-Q4 milestones)
- Update copyright year automatically (already implemented)
- Review pricing and contact information quarterly
- Revalidate all external links every 6 months
- Audit security quarterly (already documented process)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items (Acceptable for Launch)
✅ Logo.png file size (456KB) - acceptable trade-off for quality  
✅ Navigation hidden on very small screens - intentional design choice  
✅ No analytics tracking - privacy-first approach, can add later  
✅ Minimal JavaScript - reduces attack surface, good security practice

### Zero Risk Items (Fully Mitigated)
✅ Domain consistency - fully resolved  
✅ Branding consistency - 404 page fixed  
✅ Email consolidation - completed and verified  
✅ Link integrity - all links tested and working  
✅ Security - no sensitive data, comprehensive audit completed

### Post-Launch Monitoring
- DNS propagation timing (24-48 hours typical)
- Custom domain SSL certificate issuance (automatic via GitHub Pages)
- Search engine discovery (submit sitemap manually for faster indexing)
