## üö® Troubleshooting

### If GitHub Actions Fails

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/sorrowscry86/voidcat.org/actions
2. Click failed workflow
3. Expand failed step
4. Read error message
5. Common fixes:
   - Missing dependencies: Run `npm install` in workflow
   - YAML syntax error: Validate frontmatter
   - File permissions: Check repository settings

### If Article Doesn't Appear

**Check:**
1. `status: "published"` in frontmatter
2. Date not in future
3. Filename ends in `.md`
4. No YAML syntax errors
5. GitHub Actions completed successfully

**Debug:**
```powershell
# Test locally
npm run generate

# Check generated files
ls blog/index.html
ls blog/posts/
```

### If Formatting Looks Wrong

**Verify:**
1. Code blocks use triple backticks + language
2. YAML frontmatter has no syntax errors
3. Links use absolute paths (`/blog/` not `blog/`)
4. Images exist at specified paths
5. CSS loaded correctly (check browser console)
